This is the implementation of my small blogpost: To stream or to not stream. That is a question..

Inspired by the article written here Building A Streaming Fraud Detection System With Kafka And Python

The codebase for Kafka/Zookeeper stack ithes taken from the same blog post, as the author has done a brilliant work of puting the whole Kafka stack togheter in docker-compse. Many thanks to this tremendous effort, which allows my work to be implemented much easier.
